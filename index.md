# Object detection for Wind turbines

Detection of wind turbines using Fater RCNN on Google Earth Imagery

## Training a CNN based detection model
Object detection model which we trained is a CNN based model with specific backbone
Imagery used for training is freely available high resolution Google Earth Imagery (with resolution ranging up to .5m, with comparatively higher resolution in European countries (.2 to .3 m) and Japan (.2m) and updated latest in 2021 varying from area to area)
Model Input dataset consists of annotated image chipsets (bounding box around a sample turbines) preferably 256*256 dimension and specific batch size (according to GPU availability),
these chipsets are then segregated into two groups preferably in ratio 9:1 with 9 being training data and 1 being validation data
CNN model is then trained in Conda environment using Tensorflow based python libraries (pytorch, numpy etc.) until the required training loss is achieved (preferable loss<.005)

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
